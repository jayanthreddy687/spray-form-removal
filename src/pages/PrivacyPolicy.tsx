          <li>Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you</li>
          <li>To provide you with information you have requested or which we may feel may be of interest to you</li>

          <li>If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract</li>
          <li>If the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject</li>
          <li>If the processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interest pursued by us or our partners.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where legitimate interest is identified as a lawful basis, we will undertake a legitimate interest assessment which is a three-part test covering:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The purpose test – to identify the legitimate interest</li>
          <li>Necessity test – to consider if the processing is necessary for the purpose identified</li>
          <li>Balancing test – considering the individual's interests, rights or freedoms and whether these override the legitimate interests identified.</li>
        </ul>
